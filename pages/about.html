      <p class="fs-2">I am Marta, born and bred in Colombia but Spain was in my radar. It all happened in London after I took a break from Civil Engineering back home to improve my English skills, little did I know a Spaniard would be on my way, so not much English was spoken those years! We started travelling the world, settling in Singapore for over 3 years.
        Now, we're in Valencia, bringing up a 5-year-old girl and in my spare time I am fully dedicated to learning all things related to coding, looking forward to absorbing more knowledge as time goes by.</p>
